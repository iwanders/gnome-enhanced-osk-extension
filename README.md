# enhanced-osk-gnome-ext

Forked from https://github.com/cass00/enhanced-osk-gnome-ext.

Forking because all keyboards ought to have special characters in the same place; 'shift' on the number page should change the numbers to special characters, just like pressing shift+number on a real keyboard does.

# Original description

Makes Gnome's OnScreen Keyboard more usable.

Features:
* Includes additional buttons: Arrow keys, Esc, Tab, Ctrl, Alt, Super, F1-12
* Supports key combinations like `Ctrl + C`, `Alt + Tab`, `Ctrl + Shift + C`, etc.
* Configurable keyboard size (landscape/portrait)
* Statusbar indicator to toggle keyboard
* Works in Gnome password modals

Currently, the following layouts have extended keys: CH+FR, CH, DE, HU, ES, FR, IT, RU, UA, US.

## FAQ
### My language layout doesn't have the additional keys.
If the layout you're using does not have the extended keys, let me know, and I'll add them.
Or, feel free to modify it yourself (see [/src/data/osk-layouts](https://github.com/cass00/enhanced-osk-gnome-ext/tree/master/src/data/osk-layouts) dir) and make a PR.

### How do I make a custom layout?
You'll need to follow the manual installation process from [README](https://github.com/cass00/enhanced-osk-gnome-ext/blob/master/README.md#from-source-code),
but before running `package-extension.sh` you'll have to make changes to your preferred layout
(see [osk-layouts](https://github.com/cass00/enhanced-osk-gnome-ext/tree/master/src/data/osk-layouts)), then continue with the installation process.

### I want to test this extension with a new version of Gnome.
To install the extension on an unsupported Gnome version, you can either add desired version number to `metadata.json` file and proceed with a manual installation,
or disable extension version check and then install from [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4413/enhanced-osk/):

```console
gsettings set org.gnome.shell disable-extension-version-validation true
```

See [TEST_CASES](https://github.com/cass00/enhanced-osk-gnome-ext/blob/master/TEST_CASES.md) for test cases.

### Extension is installed and activated, but keyboard layout doesn't change.
Gnome's default on-screen keyboard, on which this extension is based on,
uses `ibus` package, make sure you have it installed.

### Some symbols are missing...
The keyboard uses unicode characters, try installing `ttf-symbola` on archlinux (AUR)
or `ttf-ancient-fonts-symbola` on ubuntu/debian

## Alternatives
### [GJS OSK](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5949/gjs-osk/)
Full-size Onscreen Keyboard than can be dragged around the screen.
