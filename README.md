# enhanced-osk-gnome-ext

Forked from https://github.com/cass00/enhanced-osk-gnome-ext, which itself is a second fork of the source.

Forking here to easily be able to modify the key layout used on my NixOS surface. All keyboards ought to have special characters in the same place; 'shift' on the number page should change the numbers to the special characters one would expect, just like pressing shift+number on a real keyboard does.

The default gnome on screen keyboard doesn't have this property, there's math symbols on shift number values, and apparently never had it as it came from [some android keymap](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/commit/52a779e432f16785e78a15404da3fdd6252833c3).Also, who needs `Â®`, `â„¢` or `âˆ†` in an onscreen keyboard?

Keyboard layers should also not change in width, consistency is key for any input method.

Layout of of `us.json` in this fork:
```
util$ ./render_keyboard.py ../src/data/osk-layouts/us.json

Finally found the bar above the keys element; `this._suggestions`.

## FAQ
### My language layout doesn't have the additional keys.
If the layout you're using does not have the extended keys, let me know, and I'll add them.
Or, feel free to modify it yourself (see [/src/data/osk-layouts](https://github.com/cass00/enhanced-osk-gnome-ext/tree/master/src/data/osk-layouts) dir) and make a PR.

### How do I make a custom layout?
You'll need to follow the manual installation process from [README](https://github.com/cass00/enhanced-osk-gnome-ext/blob/master/README.md#from-source-code),
but before running `package-extension.sh` you'll have to make changes to your preferred layout
(see [osk-layouts](https://github.com/cass00/enhanced-osk-gnome-ext/tree/master/src/data/osk-layouts)), then continue with the installation process.

### I want to test this extension with a new version of Gnome.
To install the extension on an unsupported Gnome version, you can either add desired version number to `metadata.json` file and proceed with a manual installation,
or disable extension version check and then install from [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4413/enhanced-osk/):

```console
gsettings set org.gnome.shell disable-extension-version-validation true
```

See [TEST_CASES](https://github.com/cass00/enhanced-osk-gnome-ext/blob/master/TEST_CASES.md) for test cases.

### Extension is installed and activated, but keyboard layout doesn't change.
Gnome's default on-screen keyboard, on which this extension is based on,
uses `ibus` package, make sure you have it installed.

### Some symbols are missing...
The keyboard uses unicode characters, try installing `ttf-symbola` on archlinux (AUR)
or `ttf-ancient-fonts-symbola` on ubuntu/debian

## Alternatives
### [GJS OSK](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5949/gjs-osk/)
Full-size Onscreen Keyboard than can be dragged around the screen.
